# Match 3

Simple game of matching 3 or more gems in a row or column.
This project was created for learning SMFL and practicing new features of C++11, 14 and 17.

## Getting Started

Select adjacent cells to swap them, if the gems match in a row or column of 3 or more of the same color, they will disappear, creating more when the top row is free.
TBD: points
